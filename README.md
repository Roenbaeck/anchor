Anchor Modeler is a database modeling tool for creating database models that handles temporalization using the sixth normal form.

See http://www.anchormodeling.com for more information on Anchor Modeling.

The tool can be downloaded and hosted on any web server. It is written in HTML5 and runs entirely in the client, with optional connection to the Cloud for loading and saving models.

A short course in Anchor Modeling using the tool can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr-yyDtkCHQ&list=PLF1451D5701662AD8&spfreload=10).
